# Missing polyfills
- ES `BigInt` can't be polyfilled since it requires changes in the behavior of operators, you can find more info [here](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/381). You could try to use [`JSBI`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi).
- ES `Proxy` can't be polyfilled, you can try to use [`proxy-polyfill`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill) which provides a very small subset of features.
- ES `String#normalize` is not a very useful feature, but this polyfill will be very large. If you need it, you can use [unorm](https://github.com/walling/unorm/).
- ECMA-402 `Intl` is missed because of the size. You can use [those polyfills](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills).
- `window.fetch` is not a cross-platform feature, in some environments, it makes no sense. For this reason, I don't think it should be in `core-js`. Looking at a large number of requests it *might be*  added in the future. Now you can use, for example, [this polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch).
